## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned from this project how to use Hover to change the shape of the buttons when being pointed to.

```css
button:hover{
    color: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.75);
    border:  solid hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.75);;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-css-media-queries/) - This is an amazing article which helped me in understanding how to use media queries.I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
